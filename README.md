# 100 Days CodeXpress Challenge by ACM AITR
I have included all the codes I have made during the 100 Days CodeXpress Challenge by ACM AITR. I will be constantly updating my GitHub with the code for each day.

### Day 1: Trekking Stamina

It's the annual Mountain Trekking Festival, and a group of N trekkers is ready to embark on their adventure. Each trekker is assigned a stamina level based on their previous trekking experiences. These stamina levels are represented in an array S, where S[i] denotes the stamina level of the ith trekker.

The trekking guide wants to determine if the group is ready for a challenging group trek. The guide will organize a Group Trek if the number of trekkers with even stamina levels is strictly greater than the number of trekkers with odd stamina levels; otherwise, they will recommend individual treks.

#### Input Format

- The first line contains T, the number of test cases.  
- The first line of each test case contains N, the number of trekkers.  
- The second line of each test case contains an array S of length N, where the ith integer denotes the stamina level of the ith trekker.

#### Solution

The solution for this problem can be found in [Day1-TrekkingStamina.cpp](Day1-TrekkingStamina.cpp).
